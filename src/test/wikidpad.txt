++ a first title

here comes some normal text with _italic_ and *bold* even *several bold words at once*
still the first paragraph because \n's are ignored as long
as
they
are single the _italic
should go over two lines, too_

finally the second paragraph




a third one without anything between them
<<pre
verbatim needs no two newlines before
>>

anywhere may by any number of [:eqn:// insets //] without warningor anything like
$ e=mc $ or even $$ \int e^{x^2}\ dx $$

another feature is the *bold \** and the _cursive \__

	[alias:value]
	
options are written \[like:this\]
	* first point
	* second point
		* first of second point
		* second of second point
	* third point
